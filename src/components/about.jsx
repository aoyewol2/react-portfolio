                        Hello! My name is Ashley, and I enjoy creating and designing things through code. I was first introduced to coding many years ago when I tried editing custom Tumblr themes, way back when I didnâ€™t even realize I was coding! 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Throughout high school, I pursued graphic and web design as both a hobby and a freelance job. In my senior year of high school, I decided to revisit coding and was inspired major in Computer Science.
