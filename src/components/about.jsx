                        Hello! My name is Ashley, and I enjoy creating and designing things through code. I was first introduced to web development many years ago when I tried editing custom Tumblr themes, way back when I didnâ€™t even realize I was coding! 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Throughout high school, I pursued graphic and web design as both a hobby and a freelance job. In my senior year of high school, I decided to revisit coding and was inspired major in Computer Science.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Fast forward to today, I am an organizer at Hack the 6ix, planning <a href="https://hackthe6ix.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={Link}>Toronto's largest summer hackathon</a>.
